Hermes is a tool to handle transfer of data between blob storage systems

This is a Python3 tool to reasonably quickly and cheaply transfer files from one
cloud vendor to another. For the sake of speedy experimentation, we only
implement the direction (gcp -> aws) that our experimenst need. 

This will be architected simply: a single VM will be stood up in the same region
as the bucket in GCP. Data will be downloaded in chunks to this VM, potentially
compressed on the fly, any checksums will be computed, and then multipart upload
requests will be made via the S3 API. 

To handle this in parallel, since each chunk can operate idemptotently, we will
have a Threadpool and a queue of tasks, where download and then subsequent
upload requests can be placed. 

Python is likely not the most efficient language to write this in, but Rust
unfortunately isn't a language im nearly as solid in and to turn this around in
a few days I need a language I know how to use and that can itnerface with HTTP
APIs easily (i.e. not C god), and Python is preferable to java for me for build
reasons
